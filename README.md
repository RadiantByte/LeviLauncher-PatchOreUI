## PatchOreUI - Modify OreUI on Android without Root

This mod is specifically made for Android because modding the OreUI (formerly known as HummingbirdUI/HBUI) is impossible on Android without using pirated Minecraft or root. This mod allows users to modify OreUI in legitimate Minecraft and without root.

**Requirements:**
*   LeviLauncher Android: <https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLaunchroid>

**How it works:**
1.  **Download OreUI Sources:**
    Download the contents of OreUI from here: https://github.com/RadiantByte/Bedrock-OreUI-Sources
    *   This repo contains OreUI sources for both Android and Windows. Windows sources are not needed in this case.

2.  **Modify and Install:**
    *   After downloading and modifying the sources, cut/copy the `gui` directory.
    *   Paste it into the `/storage/emulated/0/games/org.levimc` directory.
    *   After pasting, the directory structure should look like this:
        `/storage/emulated/0/games/org.levimc/gui/dist/hbui`
        (and inside `hbui`, all the OreUI contents).

3.  **Launch:**
    *   Load libPatchOreUI mod in LeviLauncher.
    *   Launch the game to verify the modifications.

**Alternative Method:**
There is another way of modifying this using the Ore UI Customizer website:
